Parts 1 and 2 are combined

The site has jquery validation, two-way binding jquery ui slider and text box, and tabs that have the newly generated table with its dimensions as the tab name.

Tabs can be deleted individually or completely.

The table on the current tab also updates dynamically, wheneever there is new input in the box or when the slider changes.
